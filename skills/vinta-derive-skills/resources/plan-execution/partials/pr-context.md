<!-- Partial: pr-context — the "Open PR via context file" body (former 1f), decoupled from commit-strategy. Included by integrate-phase. The commit-strategy-specific PR-open timing + prs-context file path come from commit-strategy/<resolved>.md (PR_OPEN_TIMING block + PRS_CONTEXT_FILE_PATH value). generate_inline_comments is a runtime flag whose only effect is localized here (whether the `# Comments` block is populated). -->

<!-- block-begin: PR_CONTEXT -->
This is the **only** PR-creation path. PRs always go through {{PRS_CONTEXT_FILE_PATH}} + the bundled [open-pr.sh](../open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh) script — even when inline comments are not requested. The file is the durable record; the script is the publisher. Subagents never open PRs themselves; the orchestrator does, after review passes.

{{PR_OPEN_TIMING_BLOCK}}

Two project-level signals decide the actual behavior:

| `{{PR_POLICY_BLOCK}}` policy | `run_options.generate_inline_comments` | What this step does |
|---|---|---|
| agents create PRs | false | Write minimal context file (`# Title`, `# Description`, empty `# Comments`). Run `open-pr.sh` → PR opened, no inline comments. |
| agents create PRs | true  | Write full context file (title + description + 3–10 inline comments). Run `open-pr.sh` → PR opened, all comments posted. |
| branches only     | false | **Skip this step entirely.** Human will open the PR manually from the pushed branch. |
| branches only     | true  | Write full context file (durable record). **Don't run `open-pr.sh`.** Human can publish later from a CLI-equipped session via [open-pr-from-context](../open-pr-from-context/SKILL.md). Surface this in the user update. |

### Steps

1. **Skip if neither column applies** (policy = branches only AND `generate_inline_comments = false`). Return to the conductor's tracking step.

2. **Honor existing PR / MR templates.** Read `project.pr_template_paths` from `.vinta-ai-workflows.yaml`. For each entry:
   - **One template** → load it; the prs-context `# Description` body must follow that template's section structure verbatim. Fill each section with phase-specific content drawn from the plan's **Goals + Non-goals**, **Guiding Decisions**, and the phase body. Preserve any `<!-- HTML comments -->` placeholders; do not strip the template's checklists. Sections you can't fill from phase data → leave the template's placeholder/prompt untouched (don't fabricate).
   - **Multiple templates** (`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory) → ask once via `AskUserQuestion`: list each template + its filename, ask which to use for this run. Cache the choice in tracking under `run_options.pr_template_used` so subsequent phases of the same plan use the same one without re-asking.
   - **Empty array** → free-form description. Default sections: `## Summary` (1–3 sentences), `## Plan reference` (link / phase id), `## Test plan` (commands the reviewer can run).

   When the project's PR template includes a checkbox checklist (e.g. `- [ ] Tests added`, `- [ ] Docs updated`), tick the boxes the phase's diff actually satisfies and leave unsatisfied ones unticked — never auto-tick everything.

   GitHub also honors `?template=<name>` in the PR-create URL when the project has a multi-template directory. `gh pr create --body-file` writes the body directly so the URL trick isn't needed; the body must match the chosen template's structure regardless.

3. **Pick comment targets** (only when `generate_inline_comments = true`). Read the phase diff via `git -C <WORKROOT> diff <BASE_BRANCH>...HEAD` (or the previous phase branch for stacked phases). Select 3–10 spots that benefit from a one-paragraph context note — typically:
   - A subtle invariant the diff relies on (cite the plan's **Goals + Non-goals** / **Guiding Decisions** entries — by name, never use `§` shorthand).
   - A workaround for a known framework / library limitation.
   - A naming choice driven by an upstream contract.
   - The off-flag short-circuit when a feature flag is in **Guiding Decisions**.
   - Why a seemingly-cleaner refactor wasn't made (out of scope per **Goals + Non-goals**).
   - Cross-phase coupling (this hook is consumed by phase N+k).

   Skip lint/format churn, boilerplate matching nearby files, standard patterns from AGENTS.md, and self-explanatory test names. **A clean phase produces few comments — that's fine. Don't pad.**

   When `generate_inline_comments = false`: skip this step. The file's `# Comments` block stays empty.

4. **Write the prs-context file** at {{PRS_CONTEXT_FILE_PATH}}, following [resources/prs-context-template.md](../../prs-context-template.md). Frontmatter: `plan_id`, `feature_name`, `phase_id`, `phase_title`, `branch`, `base`, `created_at`, `status: pending`, empty `pr_url`. **`base` is the branch the PR opens against — resolve it per the commit strategy, never default it to `<BASE_BRANCH>` blindly:** for stacked branches only the first executed phase bases on `<BASE_BRANCH>`; every subsequent phase bases on the **previous phase's branch** (see the PR-base rule under the {{BRANCH_PUSH_HEADING}} step above). For a single plan-level PR (modular / one-PR strategies) `base = <BASE_BRANCH>`. Body sections: `# Title` (single-line PR title), `# Description` (Markdown body — uses the project's PR template structure from step 2 when one exists), `# Comments` (YAML list of `{file, start_line, end_line?, side, body}` — empty list when comments are off).

5. **Confirm `.vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/` is in `.gitignore`.** [vinta-install-ai-tools-setup](../../../vinta-install-ai-tools-setup/SKILL.md) runs the multi-vendor setup script which appends `.vinta-ai-workflows/prs-context/` on its first invocation. If an older bootstrap missed it, append it now.

6. **Run `open-pr.sh`** (only when policy = agents create PRs). Detect a usable CLI (`gh` for GitHub, `glab` for GitLab) plus the script's other deps (`yq`, `jq`):

   ```bash
   bash ai-tools/skills/open-pr-from-context/scripts/open-pr.sh {{PRS_CONTEXT_FILE_PATH}}
   ```

   The script opens the PR (or detects an existing one), posts each inline comment, rewrites the file's frontmatter to `status: published` + populated `pr_url`, appends a publish log. Exit codes:

   - `0` — PR up, all comments (if any) posted. Capture `pr_url` for the user update.
   - `1` — PR up, ≥1 comment failed. Surface the failed `(file:line)` list to the user; continue to the tracking step.
   - `2` — Hard failure (deps missing, branch not pushed, CLI unauthed, file invalid). Surface the script's stderr; treat the phase as having no PR. The file stays `status: pending` so the user can re-run after fixing the gap.

   When policy = "branches only": **don't run the script.** File stays `status: pending`.

7. **Skill wrapper** — [open-pr-from-context](../open-pr-from-context/SKILL.md) is available for ad-hoc invocation (after the run, on a different machine, etc.). The orchestrator can call the script directly here; the skill is for humans.
