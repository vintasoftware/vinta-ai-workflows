## Resolve an `agent_models` tier to a spawn model

`.vinta-ai-workflows.yaml` may carry an `agent_models` section mapping a role/task (`reviewer`, `fixer`, `worktree_prep`, `integrate`) to a **tier** (1–4) into the same table the per-phase implementer suggestion uses — [`ai-tools/skills/plan-feature/resources/ai-models.yaml`](../plan-feature/resources/ai-models.yaml). `agent_models` is the **project default** for these roles; for `reviewer` / `fixer`, a plan phase's optional `**Review models**:` line may override the tier for that one phase (the caller resolves that precedence and hands this block the effective tier). The mechanical steps (`worktree_prep`, `integrate`) are never plan-named. To turn a tier into the model a spawn actually uses:

1. Determine the **effective tier** for the role: for `reviewer` / `fixer`, a per-phase override the conductor passed wins over `agent_models.<role>`; for the mechanical steps, it's simply `agent_models.<role>`.
2. **No effective tier (override absent AND key unset, or the whole `agent_models` section absent) → do not force a model.** Spawn with the runtime's default model (today's behavior). Skip the rest.
3. Open [`ai-tools/skills/plan-feature/resources/ai-models.yaml`](../plan-feature/resources/ai-models.yaml), take that tier's `models`, **filter to the vendors the runtime actually exposes**, pick the cheapest/fastest survivor, and translate it to the runner's spawn form — the same resolution [implement-phase](../implement-phase/SKILL.md) runs for the implementer, only keyed by a config tier instead of a plan line.
4. `ai-models.yaml` missing, or the tier has no runtime-available vendor → fall back to the runtime default and surface the fallback once. Never hard-fail a phase over a model-selection miss.

Record the **model actually used** in tracking: for `reviewer` / `fixer`, alongside the review note; for the mechanical steps, in the phase's tracking row next to the branch/PR fields.

## Delegate a mechanical step to a configured model

Two steps the conductor would otherwise run **inline in its own (usually pricier) session** — provisioning the worktree ([prepare-worktree](../prepare-worktree/SKILL.md)) and integrating a phase ([integrate-phase](../integrate-phase/SKILL.md): push the branch + open/update the PR through the bundled `open-pr.sh`) — are mechanical, precedent-driven work that a cheap model handles fine. The `agent_models.worktree_prep` / `agent_models.integrate` tiers let a project push that work down.

- **Tier set** (`worktree_prep` / `integrate`) → **spawn exactly one subagent** at the [resolved model](#resolve-an-agent_models-tier-to-a-spawn-model), hand it the step's SKILL.md plus the same inputs the conductor would use, and consume its returned report exactly as if the conductor had done the work inline. This subagent is a **labor delegate, not a decision-maker**: the conductor still owns git topology (which branch stacks on which base) and still holds every value the step returns (`WORKROOT` / `BASE_BRANCH` / worktree summary for `worktree_prep`; branch + PR-context path + `status` for `integrate`). The delegate executes and reports those back.
- **Tier unset** → run the step inline in the conductor's own session — today's behavior, no subagent.

Rules that hold **regardless of who runs the step**:

- The **PR-context file + `open-pr.sh` is still the only PR-creation path.** An `integrate` delegate uses the bundled script; it never calls raw `gh pr create` / `glab mr create`.
- The delegate is `read-write` (worktree provisioning writes dirs/DBs; integrate pushes + writes the PR-context file) but **makes no plan or code decisions** — a malformed or failed delegate report is surfaced to the user, never worked around.
- This delegation is **separate from the phase-work sub-agents** (implementer / reviewer / fixer). Those still never branch, push, or open PRs — that prohibition is about code-authoring agents, not the dedicated mechanical delegate the conductor spawns to run the integrate step itself.
